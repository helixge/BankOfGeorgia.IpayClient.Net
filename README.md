## How To Use
See [ASP.NET Core integration guide](#integrating-with-aspnet-core) below

### Define options
```csharp
var clientOptions = new BankOfGeorgiaIpayClientOptions()
{
    ClientId = "your-ipay-client-id",
    SecretKey = "your-ipay-client-secret",
};
```

### Create client
```csharp
var client = new BankOfGeorgiaIpayClient(clientOptions);
```


## Integrating with ASP.NET Core
To integrate the client with ASP.NET Core dependency injection pipeline, use the following steps:

1. Add an entry in your appSettings.json file and specify your iPay `ClientId` and `SecretKey`):
```js
{
   //...other options
   
   "iPay": {
      "ClientId": "your-ipay-client-id",
      "SecretKey": "your-ipay-client-secret",
   }
  
   //...other options
}
```

2. Call ```AddBankOfGeorgiaIpay``` in ```ConfigureServices``` method of ```Startup.cs``` and specify the configuration parameter name containing the options array (for this example we called the entry ```iPay```):
````csharp
services.AddBankOfGeorgiaIpay(
  Configuration.GetBankOfGeorgiaIpayClientOptions("iPay")
);
````

> Make sure you have access to ```Configuration```. If you are missing configuration, you can inject it in your `Startup`:
```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }
}
```

3. Inject ```IBankOfGeorgiaIpayClient``` and use in your code:
````csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IBankOfGeorgiaIpayClient _iPayClient;

    public HomeController(
        IBankOfGeorgiaIpayClient iPayClient
        )
    {
        _iPayClient = iPayClient;
    }

    //...other methods
}
````

## Methods

* **MakeRecurringOrderAsync**    
Place an order for a recurring payments without user's interraction. You need to create an initial order to use recurring payments, where the user will enter their credit card details for the Bank to remember. You will need an ID of an existing order to perform additional reocurring orders.\

If you don't want to charge the user for the first time and want the Bank to remember the card details for future use, you will still have to create an initial order for the minimum amount of 0.10 GEL and then you refund it.

There are two ways the transaction can be processed, called the `capture_method`: \
`- AUTOMATIC` \
`- MANUAL` \

    > This method encapsulates a [/api/v1/checkout/refund](https://api.bog.ge/docs/en/ipay/refund).
